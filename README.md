README

Hello! This is the codebase for my WIP AI Companion project. It (will) work like any other AI companion site/app you've seen as an MVP, and was a fun challenge for me to build from scratch. I'm a Data Scientist by day, not an engineer, so I've enjoyed the challenge of having to build an application from the ground up. It's taught me more in-depth uses of Flask, and forced me to really engage with webapp modules I've never really thought about before. How does user authentication work? What really goes on in Docker images & containers? How do we make sure server/client packages are sent securely and write quickly to a structured database? Why do people complain about CSS templates so much? 

I'm embarking on this journey in my free time for the fun and sport of all of it! It's been a great learning adventure so far, and as I commit more to this repo it should slowly come to life. Will update this doc with a website link once it's fully operational online! Until then, enjoy my WIP code.
